<!-- Plan for Fortran FOSDEM talk
- Provide data about Fortran code being untested
- Describe why testing Fortran is hard
    - Legacy code which often uses lots of global state
    - Legacy dependencies make it hard to port to new environments such as CI pipelines.
    - Introduce reasons this may be the case
    - Black box legacy code
        - Unclear which tool to choose (lot's of options with little guidance)
        - Show current landscape (post in fortran lang)
- Why pFUnit is the one we tend to choose
    - Can test MPI
    - Most fully featured
    - Is in active development
    - Accepting contributions
        - Include example of fixing intel 22 bug in a Day/weekend
- How pFUnit works
    - Attempts to look like other testing frameworks
        - Define inputs and outputs for parametrization
    - How you can use it in CI workflows (docker)
- Introduce the Fortran course I have been working on and possibly Fortran tooling -->
