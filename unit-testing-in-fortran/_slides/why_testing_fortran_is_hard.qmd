## Why is testing Fortran hard {.smaller}

:::: {layout-ncol=2}

### Reasons

- Fortran is often legacy code.
  - Lots of global state.
  - Locked into specific compilers or dependencies.
  - Sometimes a bit of a black box.
- Unclear which tool to choose.

### Side effects

- Tests must be isolated.
  - Requires, one test per executable or complicated state handling.
- Must be supported by the choosen test framework
- Not clear what to test (not actually a problem IMHO)
- Many custom testing setups exist
  - Test frameworks do not benefit from open source contibutions.
